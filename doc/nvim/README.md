# Compilation of commands

Vim (in my case nvim) is awesome, but I'm a forgetful individual so I like to keep a tidy house when it comes to what I can do with the tools I have. This document compiles a list of the most useful commands I have for nvim and the libraries I use, as well as some theory on how it works.

## Vim utilities

- `C` is the Control key (`c` is just normal c key)
- `,` is the Leader key
- `C-Shift-Ã‡` to open/hide the terminal from anywhere
- `Alt-<number>` to switch panes in terminal
- `Cmd-Alt-i` to input to all panes on current tab
